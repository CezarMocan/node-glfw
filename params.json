{"name":"Node-glfw","body":"NodeJS bindings to GLFW & AntTweakBar\r\n=====================================\r\n\r\nThis projects attempts to provide platform-independent access to windowing system and input devices on desktop/laptop computers.\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\n- NodeJS\r\nWhile v0.6.5+ work in many cases, some missing features for typed arrays are only available in v0.7.x. So we recommend at least v0.7.5.\r\n\r\n- GLEW (http://glew.sourceforge.net/)\r\nGLEW is used to find OpenGL extensions in a cross-platform manner.\r\n\r\n- GLFW (http://www.glfw.org/)\r\nGLFW is a simple multi-platform framework for opening a window, creating an OpenGL context, and managing input.\r\n\r\n- AntTweakBar (http://www.antisphere.com/Wiki/tools:anttweakbar)\r\nAntTweakBar allows programmers to quickly add a light and intuitive graphical user interface into graphic applications to interactively tweak parameters on-screen. \r\n\r\nAll of these libraries are cross-platform. node-glfw provides a Javascript wrapper to access native methods in GLFW and AntTweakBar. See example of usage in node-webgl/test/cube.js.\r\n\r\nInstallation (Mac, Linux)\r\n-------------------------\r\nInstall GLFW and make sure examples are working. For convenience, install GLFW into your system lib/include path.\r\n\r\nInstall AntTweakBar and make sure its GLFW samples are working. For convenience, install AntTweakBar libraries in your system lib path.\r\n\r\nInstall GLEW and make sure its tests programs are working such as visualinfo. You should install GLEW in your system lib/include path.\r\n\r\nNow you can install node-glfw, the usual way: npm install node-glfw.\r\n\r\nInstallation (Windows)\r\n-------------------------\r\nCopy all deps/*.lib into your <Visual Studio>/VC/lib for 32-bit libraries, and <Visual Studio>/VC/lib/amd64 for 64-bit libraries.\r\nCopy all deps/*.dll into <Windows>/System32.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n-----\r\n- node-glfw is a just a platform binding so don't expect samples here. You should install node-webgl, which contains lots of tests and examples using node-glfw features including AntTweakBar. See node-webgl/test/cube.js for an example of using AntTweakBar with your webgl code.\r\n\r\n\r\n","tagline":"nodejs bindings to GLFW & AntTweakBar","google":"UA-32803813-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
